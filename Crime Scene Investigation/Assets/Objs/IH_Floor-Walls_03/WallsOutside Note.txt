This model is on the outside of the walls to block off
the light in Unity.
It is not unwrapped or textured. Its only purpose is to
block off outside light.

If there is a different fix for the lights.
Then you can use that instead.


Update:
I closed off the space between the inner and outer
walls with window and door holes.
(only doors leading outside the building)
